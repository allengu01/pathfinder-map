Currently, I've implemented a breadth-first search algorithm to find the shortest path, and plan on adding more in the near future.

The animations and breadth first search algorithm were coded from scratch. The project was inspired by [Clement Mihailescu](https://github.com/clementmihailescu/Pathfinding-Visualizer) and I used his implementation of the grid as a guideline.
