This website is a visualization tool for pathfinding and searching algorithms. Visit the website here: https://allengu01.github.io/pathfinder-map/

Currently, I've implemented a breadth-first search algorithm to find the shortest path, and plan on adding more in the near future.

The project was inspired by [Clement Mihailescu](https://github.com/clementmihailescu/Pathfinding-Visualizer), but coded from scratch with HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
